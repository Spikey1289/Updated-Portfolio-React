# Updated-Portfolio-React

## Introduction
This is the README for the Updated Portfolio challenge of my coding bootcamp. This Repository contains the jsx, js, and assets for my updated portfolio using React. It's a single page application that shows off a list of some of my applications/repos.

## Things Learned
I learned a LOT about React and React Router during this challenge. I also learned how to make a downloadable file for the user to have access to.
