                <p>Hello, my name is Ian Stevenson.</p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;I'm 25 years old, and I've been spending many of those years interested in various kinds of technology.
                    Right out of highschool I was interested in spaceflight. Then I built my first tower computer, and I realized that I enjoyed working with 
                    computers. I realized that I think similarly to the thing I was spending so much time playing games on. After a break of a few months,
                    I decided to explore computer programming as a potential career path. I took limited numbers of courses in C#, Java, and eventually 
                    landed in a Boot Camp teaching Web Development. I've spent the past few months learning HTML, JavaScript, MySQL, Express, React, and
                    several other technologies.

                <p>
                    &emsp;In my spare time I swim, play video games, work on side-projects involving photography, and volunteer at a Hospice Organization
                    doing office work.
                </p>
